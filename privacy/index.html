  <h4>Information we collect</h4>
  <p>If you enable push notifications, we need to store the token your device gives us to send them. We only ever use push notifications to notify you of the weather alerts you have selected. We never use push notifications for marketing.</p>

  <h4>Information usage</h4>
  <p>We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, app, and customer support.</p>
  <p>We do not send your geo-located coordinates (current location) over the network at any time. The coordinates are processed on the device so there is no chance of the coordinates being intercepted or saved to our servers.</p>
  <p>We do not share your personal information with outside parties, with the exception of <a href="https://www.fabric.io">Fabric</a>, which is embedded in Météo's iOS app to provide crash reporting and basic analytics to help us improve the app.</p>
  <p>We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.</p>
  <p>In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.</p>

  <h4>Security</h4>
  <p>We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure.</p>
  <p>For instance, all communication with the app requires HTTPS.</p>
  <p>To reiterate, we do not send your geo-located coordinates (current location) over the network at any time. The coordinates are processed on the device so there is no chance of the coordinates being intercepted or saved to our servers.</p>
