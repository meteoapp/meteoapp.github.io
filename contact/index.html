  <p>My name is Cory Jacobsen. I like working on small side projects, and spend a lot of my free time working on this app. I still have a full-time job, so all development and support usually happens outside of business hours.</p>

  <p>I welcome your thoughts and feedback on the app. Feel free to each me directly at <a href="mailto:cory@meteoapp.ca">cory@meteoapp.ca</a>.</p>

  <p>I will try to read and consider every email, but I can’t respond to them all. I wish I could, but I can’t. (That’s life.) Thanks for understanding.</p>

  <p>You can also download a press kit <a href="/assets/Meteo-PressKit.zip?v={{ site.version }}">here</a>.</p>
