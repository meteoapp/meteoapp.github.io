  <h4>Does Météo work on iPhone and iPad?</h4>
  <p>Yes! Météo was built and designed to work on all devices running iOS 10 and above.</p>

  <h4>Why is the app free?</h4>
  <p>I wanted to bring the best app to the most people possible without making them purchase the app and without hiding the
    best features behind in-app purchases.</p>

  <h4>Which weather locations are available?</h4>
  <p>Météo utilizes data from <a href="https://www.ec.gc.ca/cc/">Environment and Climate Change Canada</a>. You can see a full
    list of weather locations on their <a href="https://weather.gc.ca/">weather site</a>.</p>
